# AI-Safety-Audit
AI Safety Audit is intended to resolve the safety concerns by reverse mechanisms of using AI.

## Summary
Since the advancement of AI brought a lot of advancement in resolving complex problems, at the same time it raised diverse societal concerns and challenges about the safety of its use. This project is intended to chalk out the challenges and to find the befitting solution through utilization of AI in reverse mechnasim.


## Background

After revelation of Chat GPT and its  mass acceptance without prior societal and legal preparedness, highlighted multiple concerns that could lead to an inapproprioate and distructive use of Artificial intelligence such as;

1. Privacy Concerns
2. Ethecal Dilemmas
3. Bias and Discriminatory info.
4. Educational Pattern & its revision
5. Job market and human existential concerns etc.


## How is it used?

This is a diverse field and each challenge/Problem requires deep learning and planning, however a systematic process could have been developed to work on. it.

   # write your solution here

 It is too early to predict the solution however it requires time and patience to carefully pick every problem evolving due to the use of AI and syetematically craft the procedure and train of AI on it.

## Challenges

Research and Time

## What next?

I am passionate to work with a team of experts as collectively the complex problems could have been broken down to small and resolvales bits.
